# Image-Processing-Object-Counting-on-a-Convey-Belt
This is regarding the image processing assignment given under the module EN-2550.
Here I had counted and tracked the hexagonal nuts on a moving convey belt.
I applied background subtraction, contour representation and template matching followed by object moments interpretation as the detection, modeling and tracking methods respectively.
